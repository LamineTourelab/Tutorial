    "# Getting Started with RNA Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA velocity is based on bridging measurements to a underlying mechanism, mRNA splicing, with two modes indicating the current and future state [[RNA velocity—current challenges and future perspectives](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202110282)].  It is a method used to predict the future gene expression of a cell based on the measurement of both spliced and unspliced transcripts of mRNA [[2](https://towardsdatascience.com/rna-velocity-the-cells-internal-compass-cf8d75bb2f89)].\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA velocity could be used to infer the direction of gene expression changes in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It provides insights into the future state of individual cells by using the abundance of unspliced to spliced RNA transcripts. This ratio can indicate the transcriptional dynamics and potential fate of a cell, such as whether it is transitioning from one cell type to another or undergoing differentiation [[RNA velocity of single cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130801/)].\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **velocyto**\n",
    "\n",
    "Velocyto is a package for the analysis of expression dynamics in single cell RNA seq data. In particular, it enables estimations of RNA velocities of single cells by distinguishing unspliced and spliced mRNAs in standard single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. It is the first paper proposed the concept of RNA velocity. velocyto predicted RNA velocity by solving the proposed differential equations for each gene [[RNA velocity of single cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130801/)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ **scVelo**\n",
    "\n",
    "scVelo is a method that solves the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. scVelo was applied to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. scVelo demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamical model on various cell lineages in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis [[Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell states through dynamical modeling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0591-3)].\n",

    "\n",
    "First of all, the input data for scVelo are two count matrices of pre-mature (unspliced) and mature (spliced) abundances, which were obtained from standard sequencing protocols, using the velocyto."

    "## Estimate RNA velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA velocity estimation can currently be tackled with three existing approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "• steady-state / deterministic model (using steady-state residuals)\n",
    "\n",
    "• stochastic model (using second-order moments),\n",
    "\n",
    "• dynamical model (using a likelihood-based framework).\n",
    "\n",
    " + **The steady-state / deterministic model:**, as being used in velocyto, estimates velocities as follows: Under the assumption that transcriptional phases (induction and repression) last sufficiently long to reach a steady-state equilibrium (active and inactive),**`velocities are quantified as the deviation of the observed ratio from its steady-state ratio`**. The equilibrium mRNA levels are approximated with a linear regression on the presumed steady states in the lower and upper quantiles. This simplification makes two fundamental assumptions: a common splicing rate across genes and steady-state mRNA levels to be reflected in the data. It can lead to errors in velocity estimates and cellular states as the assumptions are often violated, in particular when a population comprises multiple heterogeneous subpopulation dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " + **The stochastic model:** aims to better capture the steady states. By treating transcription, splicing and degradation as probabilistic events, the resulting Markov process is approximated by moment equations. By including secondorder moments, **`it exploits not only the balance of unspliced to spliced mRNA levels but also their covariation`**. It has been demonstrated on the endocrine pancreas that stochasticity adds valuable information, overall yielding higher consistency than the deterministic model, while remaining as efficient in computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " + **The dynamical model:** (most powerful while computationally most expensive) solves the full dynamics of splicing kinetics for each gene. **`It thereby adapts RNA velocity to widely varying specifications such as non-stationary populations, as does not rely on the restrictions of a common splicing rate or steady states to be sampled`**.\n",
    " \n",
    "     The splicing dynamics \n",
    "     \n",
    "     `𝑑𝑢(𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛼𝑘(𝑡) − 𝛽𝑢(𝑡), (4.1)` \n",
    "     \n",
    "     `𝑑𝑠(𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛽𝑢(𝑡) − 𝛾𝑠(4.2) (𝑡)`,\n",
    "     \n",
    "     is solved in a likelihood-based expectation-maximization framework, **`by iteratively estimating the parameters of reaction rates and latent cell-specific variables`**, i.e. transcriptional state k and cell-internal latent time t.It thereby aims to learn the unspliced/spliced phase trajectory. Four transcriptional states are modeled to account for all possible configurations of gene activity: two dynamic transient states (induction and repression) and two steady states (active and inactive) potentially reached after each dynamic transition."

Transcriptional induction for a particular gene results in an **increase of (newly transcribed) precursor unspliced mRNAs** while, conversely, repression or absence of transcription results in a **decrease of unspliced mRNAs**. Spliced mRNAs is produced from unspliced mRNA and follows the same trend with a time lag. Time is a hidden/latent variable. Thus, the dynamics needs to be inferred from what is actually measured: spliced and unspliced mRNAs as displayed in the phase portrait."
